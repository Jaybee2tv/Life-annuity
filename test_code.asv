%[f,fp] = f_alpha(0,k,1, date, age, 20); 
[alp, kap, bet] = leeCar_NR(date, age, 600, 1e-6); %if there's problem, plz increase max_iter

%% plotting residual 

[resi, squa] = residual(date, age, alp, bet, kap); %plot year, age etc...

%% Comparison LeeCar VS real death rate
compare(date,age, alp,bet,kap)
